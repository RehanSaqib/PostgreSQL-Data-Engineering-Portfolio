# 04 - Advanced Logic & CTEs

This folder focuses on writing modular and readable code for complex, multi-step data transformations.

### Concepts Covered:
* **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Using `WITH` clauses for cleaner logic.
* **Correlated Subqueries**: Queries that depend on the outer query.
* **Nested Queries**: Queries within the WHERE or FROM clauses.
* **EXISTS & IN**: Logic-based data filtering.

> *Purpose: Simplifying complex business logic into readable modules.*
